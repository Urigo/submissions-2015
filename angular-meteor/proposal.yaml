  Title: angular-meteor - Perfect stack, a match made in heaven!
  Description: >
    Meteor 1.0 just been released and it is extremely powerful, fast and simple.

    As a hard-core AngularJS developer for many years I wasn't going to give up Angular to get Meteor's powers.
    So I've created the angular-meteor library to make any AngularJS app work with Meteor easily and seamlessly.

    In this talk I'll share how to write angular-meteor web and mobile applications,
    how to integrate Meteor into your existing Angular application,
    how I wrote the library and lessons I learned about both Frameworks.

    Uri is the creator of the angular-meteor package which makes the integration between AngularJS and Meteor as seamless as possible.
    Uri travels around the world building stuff and consulting to various companies.
    Started with assembler, C++, then C# and WPF before taking on the web a few years ago.
    Since then he regularly speaks and lectures about AngularJS until moving on to develop the library 'angular-meteor' and now he is talking about angular-meteor every chance he gets.
