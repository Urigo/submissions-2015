  Title: angular-meteor - Working with the 2 great eco-systems together
  Description: >
    Meteor 1.0 just been released and the great power it gives to proggramers is amazing.
    As a hard core AngularJS developer I wasn't so happy with their choice to invent a new templating engine called Blaze.
    Reserching into thier code I've found why they did that and why it doesn't stop me from using AngularJS.
    Better then that, I can use all the power, simplicity and eco-system of AngularJS together with all the tools of Meteor
    (including Meteor's great power integration with Cordova). A real match from heavens!
    After 2 production apps with Meteor, AngularJS and Ionic Framwork I have to say, there is nothing compared to that!
